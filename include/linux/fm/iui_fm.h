/**
 * @brief Prototype for a Frequency Mitigation Request Callback Function, to be
 *        implemented by Frequency Manager Macros to receive Frequency
 *        Mitigation Request messages from Frequency Manager.
 *
 * A macro's implementation of this callback would be called by Frequency
 * Manager to request it to change its operating frequency and/or other
 * operating parameter(s) in order to mitigate a crosstalk or interference
 * between two or more macros.
 *
 * Implementations of this prototype may process the mitigation request
 * synchronously or asynchronously. By returning
 * IUI_FM_MITIGATION_ASYNC_PENDING, an implementation indicates to Frequency
 * Manager that it has scheduled or otherwise queued the mitigation request for
 * processing asynchronously in another context, and further agrees to call the
 * iui_fm_mitigation_complete() API when it is finished processing the
 * Mitigation Request.  Any other return value indicates that the mitigation
 * request has been processed syncrhonously, and no subsequent call to the
 * iui_fm_mitigation_complete() API is needed.
 *
 * If returning IUI_FM_MITIGATION_COMPLETE_NOT_ACCEPTABLE to indicate that the
 * requested mitigation is not possible at the time, the mitigation argument
 * must be updated to reflect the operating mode/frequency of the macro after
 * the callback, which need not be the same as it was prior to the callback.
 * In this way the macro may make a change to the operating mode/frequency in
 * response to the mitigation request, but not exactly what was requested.
 * This may be treated as a new Frequency Notification from the macro by the
 * Frequency Manager.
 *
 * Implementations of this callback prototype are registered and deregistered
 * dynamically via the iui_fm_register_mititagion_callback API.  Only one
 * callback per Macro ID can be registered at a time.
 *
 * @param macro_id     Identifies the macro whose frequency and/or operating
 *                     parameters is being requested to change.
 * @param mitigation   Pointer to the Frequency Mitigation information
 *                     requested by Frequency Manager. If the callback returns
 *                     IUI_FM_MITIGATION_COMPLETE_NOT_ACCEPTABLE, then it is
 *                     also used as an output argument.  In this case the macro
 *                     must update the argument with the current macro-specific
 *                     mitigation information.
 * @param sequence     Sequence number used internally by Frequency Manager to
 *                     synchronize multiple in-flight Frequency Mitigation
 *                     requests to a macro.  If returning
 *                     IUI_FM_MITIGATION_ASYNC_PENDING, then this value must be
 *                     passed back unmodified to the
 *                     iui_fm_mitigation_complete() API once the macro is
 *                     finished processing the Frequency Change Request, unless
 *                     this callback is called again by Frequency Manager with
 *                     a newer Mitigation Request in which case the older
 *                     request may be dropped.
